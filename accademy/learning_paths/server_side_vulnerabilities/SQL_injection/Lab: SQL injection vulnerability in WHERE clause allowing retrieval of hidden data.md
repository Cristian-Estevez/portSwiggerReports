# Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

## Description

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.

## Solution

1. First to understand the regular request click on any category.
1. Look at the browser's url bar:

    ```url
    [...]web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Accessories
    ```

1. The parameter ```category``` is the one the backend uses to construct the SQL query.
1. Change it to ```category=Accesories' or 1=1 --``` to solve the lab.
